"""Determines whether we can compute a valid join for the given inputs.

For example:

I have a node containing a measure that's needed for a metric, and I also have a list of dimensions that I need for that
measure.

Can I join that node with other nodes using a common entity to get those dimensions? If so, what are those nodes,
what entity should I join on, and if I do that join, what dimensions can be retrieved?

Note: the term "dimension" is used below, but it actually refers to any LinkableInstance. Also, when you see the term
"start_node", think "node containing the measure". Using the term "start_node" as the scenario of joining measure nodes
to dimension nodes is an easy case to explain, but there are non-measure nodes that can be joined with dimension nodes
to realize other planned features.
