        """Context manager used to track pushdown state along branches in a Dataflow Plan.

        This retains a sequence of pushdown state objects to allow for tracking pushdown opportunities along
        the current branch. Each entry represents the predicate pushdown state as of that point, and as such
        callers need only concern themselves with the value returned by the last_pushdown_state property.

        The back-propagation of pushdown_applied_where_filter_specs is necessary to ensure the outer query
        node can evaluate which where filter specs needs to be applied. We capture the complete set because
        we may have sequenced nodes where some where filters are applied (e.g., time dimension filters might
        be applied to metric time nodes, etc.).

        The state tracking and propagation is built to work as follows:

        For a simple DAG of where_node -> join_node -> source_nodes there will be two branches:

            where_node -> join_node -> left_source_node
            where_node -> join_node -> right_source_node

        In this case the where_node receives the initial predicate pushdown state, and then adds its own
        updated state object (with the where filters) via the context manager and propagates that to the join_node.

        The join_node then receives the where_node's predicate pushdown state, and, for each branch, adds an
        updated state object via the context manager and propagates the updated state objects to the next node.

        The left_source_node gets the join node's left branch state and evaluates it. If it can apply any filters
        it adds an updated state object to note that the filters are applied and propagates it along via the context
        manager. In this case, the context manager exits immediately and returns to the left_source_node, which
        finishes with applying the where constraints and returns back to the join_node.

        At this point, the join node has a left branch context manager with the left_join_branch pushdown state. The
        join_node does NOT have access to the left_source_node's pushdown state, but it needs to be able to notify its
        parent, the where_node, that some filters have been applied at the left_source_node.

        How does it do this? The left_source_node's state update included applied where filters. When the context
        manager exits it propagates the left_source_node's applied where filters back up to the preceding state (in
        this case, the join node's left branch state). The same thing happens when the branch states for the join
        node exit the context manager, so the where_node then sees the union of all filters applied downstream.

        The where_node, then, has access to the complete set of filters applied downstream.

        This is complicated because of joins - we can't store a single set of applied filters, because there's no good
        way to keep them organized in the case of multiple join branches. Instead, we track up and down a single
        branch, and merge the events of parent branches at the join nodes that created them.

        In particular, if a given branch is ever a target of any OUTER JOIN we cannot safely push down any filter that
        might allow for a NULL value, as that affects query semantics. In other words, the left branch cannot allow
        predicate pushdown for these filter types if there is even a single FULL OUTER or RIGHT OUTER JOIN in the

        Note - at this time we only apply time constraints to measure nodes, and those are always on the left side
