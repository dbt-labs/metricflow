  description: |
    Each row represents one transaction. There
    will be a new row for any cancellations or alterations.
    There is a transaction, order, and customer id for
    every transaction. There is only one transaction id per
    transaction, but there can be many rows per order id and
    customer id. The `ds` or date is reflected in UTC.
