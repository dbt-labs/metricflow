  name: semi_additive_measure_query_with_join_linkable_specs
  description: |
    Tests semi-additive measure with a path hitting join linkable specs.
    There are cases (like this query where we have a non-local linkable spec "user__home_state_latest") where
    we are directly copying a MeasureSpec via constructing it. Previously, this led to a code path not passing all the attributes,
    then somewhere along the path it would end up throwing a MeasureSpec not in [List of MeasureSpec] due to an attribute
    being missing. This test case hits that path and ensures that we are copying attributes correctly.
