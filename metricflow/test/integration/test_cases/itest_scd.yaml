  name: scd_constrained_metric_with_nulls
  description: |
    Tests selecting an SCD-constrained metric with a group by where the constraint allows
    NULL values for the dimension. This means any missed rows in the join will be included
    there. In this query, the group by includes the constraint dimension, so the nulls
    are highlighted in the result output. However, if we did not group by the constraint dimension
    the results would be silently incorrect, as the is_instant count would be off by one in the output.
