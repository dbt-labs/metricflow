"""Helper classes to convert model objects to spec object representations.

In some cases we need to take a model object and convert it to a spec for use in a DataflowPlan or similar.
This fundamentally requires us to combine a model object with a spec object and, in some cases, follow semantic
metadata about linked specs in order to resolve dimension names and the like.

Since model objects and specs should not depend on each other, we do these conversions separately via external
classes, rather than the perhaps more natural approach of adding a to_spec() method on the model objects. These
shims likely point to the need for a bit of an internal refactor, but that's a concern for another time.
