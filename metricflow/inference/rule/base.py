    An inference rule produces zero or more `InferenceSignal` instances about whatever
    columns it thinks it should, based on input `InferenceContext`s.

    Concrete implementations should aim to be short and modularized. It is preferred to
    compose multiple small rules that each produce a signal type than to make one large
    rule with complex logic to produce a bunch of signals.

    It currently only accepts DataWarehouseInferenceContext as input, but this will probably
    be generalized later.
