    The core MetricFlow SqlClient is effectively a read-only construct, as MetricFlow is meant to compile and run SQL
    for metric queries, not manage downstream database state.

    However, it can be useful to have a SqlClient that can do DDL. In this case, we use these methods in our warehouse
    engine integration tests for setup and teardown. All of the SqlClients we use in our tests must implement this
    protocol, or else the integration tests cannot be run.
