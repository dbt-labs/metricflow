test_name: test_skipped_pushdown
test_filename: test_predicate_pushdown_rendering.py
docstring:
  Tests rendering a query where we expect to skip predicate pushdown because it is unsafe.

      This is the query rendering test for the scenarios where the push down evaluation indicates that we should
      skip pushdown, typically due to a lack of certainty over whether or not the query will return the same results.

      The specific scenario is less important here than that it match one that should not be pushed down.
