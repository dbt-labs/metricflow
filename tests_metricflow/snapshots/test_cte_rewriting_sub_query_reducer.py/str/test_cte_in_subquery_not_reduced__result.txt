test_name: test_cte_in_subquery_not_reduced
test_filename: test_cte_rewriting_sub_query_reducer.py
docstring:
  This tests that in cases where there is a CTE defined in a sub-query, it is not reduced.
expectation_description:
  A sub-query containing CTEs should not result in the top-level query being merged with the sub-query. For
  this case, the SQL should be the same before / after optimization.
