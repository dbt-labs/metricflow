"""Shim to allow support for both Pydantic 1 and Pydantic 2.

DSI must support both major versions of Pydantic because dbt-core depends on DSI. dbt-core users might be using an
environment with either version, and we can't restrict them to one or the other. Here, we essentially import all
Pydantic objects from version 1. Throughout the repo, we import those objects from this file instead of from Pydantic
directly, meaning that we essentially only use Pydantic 1 in this repo, but without forcing that restriction on dbt
users. The development environment for this repo should be pinned to Pydantic 1 to ensure devs get appropriate type
hints.
