        We want to make sure that features are distinct and discoverable,
        so that other members of the community can find them and offer their thoughts.

        Issues are the right place to request straightforward extensions of existing metricflow functionality.
        For "big ideas" about future capabilities of metricflow, we ask that you open a
        [discussion](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/discussions) in the "Ideas" category instead.
