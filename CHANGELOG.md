## [Unreleased]

## [0.110.1] - 2022-07-25

### Fixed
- Cleaned up package metadata and broken links in external README viewers (@tlento)
- Fixed cases where output columns were rendering in the wrong order (@williamdee)

### Updated
- Improved model config schema validation to return all jsonschema errors instead of one at a time (@QMalcolm)
- Streamlined rendered SQL to use BETWEEN expressions for date range checks (@williamdee)

## [0.110.0] - 2022-07-21

### Breaking Changes
- Updated query inputs for time series dimensions to use `metric_time` instead of dimension names, since it is now possible for measures to have different time dimensions for time series aggregation. This also removes the restriction that all data sources have the same primary time dimension name. However, users issuing queries might experience exceptions if they are not using `metric_time` as their requested primary time dimension. (@plypaul)
- Added enforcement for new reserved keyword `metric_time` (@tlento)
- Reordered column output to `time dimension, identifiers, dimensions, metrics`, which could break automation relying on order-dependent parsing of CLI output. We encourage affected users to switch to using the API, and to access the resulting data frame with order-independent (i.e., by name) access to column values. (@williamdee)
- Removed support for SQLite - expected impact is minimal as the repo has been cut to DuckDB for in memory testing (@plypaul)

### Added
- Support for specifying measure-specific time dimensions for time series aggregations (@plypaul)
- Validation against use of SQL reserved keywords as element names, which previously would have resulted in SQL errors at query time (@QMalcolm)

### Updated
- Improved code structure around the model validation process (@QMalcolm)
- Improved readability of model validation errors in CLI output (@QMalcolm)
- Cleaned up DuckDB documentation (@yanghua)
- Fixed edge case with model parsing where a constraint like `ds = CURRENT_DATE()` would throw an error (@tlento)
- Restructured config parser to rely more on Pydantic's built in object parsing, allowing for more - and more standardized - customization on input types and parsing mechanics (@tlento)
- Removed framework operation comments from SQL explain plans by default, added a flag to override (@williamdee, @nhandel)
- Updated Click to 8.1.3 to resolve dependency conflicts and facilitate later addition of command completion (@jack-transform)
- Improved developer documentation and workflows for PostgreSQL

## [0.100.2] 2022-06-24

## Updated
- Updated numpy version to 1.23.0 to fix issues with operations on m1 macbooks (@serramatutu)
- Downgraded DuckDB version to 0.3.4 to fix segfaults observed with multithreaded operations (@plypaul)
- Added YAML linting to model validation process to catch syntax errors more explicitly (@QMalcolm)


## [0.100.1] - 2022-06-23

### Updated
- Fixed CLI support for PostgreSQL (@plypaul)
- Improved validation error messaging (@QMalcolm)

## [0.100.0] - 2022-06-22

### Breaking Changes
- Updated MetricFlow config parameters for BigQuery users. See description on https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/62 for usage instructions.

### Added
- Metric / dimension SQL validations via DW engine (@QMalcolm)
- Support for PostgreSQL and setup for local testing (@rexledesma)
- Support for DuckDB (@plypaul)
- Support for individual user logins to BigQuery (@WilliamDee)
- Ability to create the MetricFlow client from a model in a specified directory (@WilliamDee)
- Description and owner fields to model objects (@WilliamDee)

### Updated
- CLI tests without mocks (@WilliamDee)
- Package dependencies to address security issues (@alliehowe)
- Query cancellation behavior on CLI exit (@plypaul)

## [0.93.0] - 2022-04-27

### Added
- Simple Developer API for interacting with MetricFlow engine based on a local config file for Warehouse credentials (@williamdee)
- Config validation for Materialization structs (@lebca)
- Config templates for useful metrics sourced from Salesforce data, for use by end users of MetricFlow (@JStein77)


## [0.92.1] - 2022-04-13

### Added

- Ability to visualize DataFlow Plan from the command line via the `--display-plans` flag (@plypaul)

### Fixed

- Resolved BigQuery read credential failures on multi-line service account keys (@zzsza)
- Resolved ciso8601 installation failures on Ubuntu (@plypaul)
- Merge-blocking CI test failures and configuration errors (@marcodamore, @tlento)
- Typing errors in MeasureReference (@lebca)

### Removed
- Remove legacy interfaces (@andykram)
- Remove legacy time_format parameters from test models (@belindabennett)

### Updated
