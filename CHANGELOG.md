## MetricFlow [0.140.0] - 2023-01-12

### Breaking Changes

- Result layout is changing from one row per metric/null dimension valued pair to one row per null dimension value regardless of number of metrics in the query. This only affects queries for multiple metrics where the requested dimensions contain null values. See the description on the [relevant PR](https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/366) for more detailed information and an example illustrating how the output will change.
- Updates to the required SqlClient protocol could cause typechecking failures for users injecting a custom SqlClient implementation into the MetricFlowClient
- Version minimum changes in SQLAlchemy and snowflake-sqlalchemy could cause dependency conflicts when installed in python environments with libraries requiring an older version of either of these dependencies.

### Added

- Support for derived metrics - users can now define metrics based on expressions that use other metrics in the model as inputs. For example usage, see the description in the [initial PR](https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/281) (@WilliamDee)
- Support for versioned dimension joins against a standard Slowly Changing Dimension snapshot table (SCD Type II dataset) - users can now define a data source representing a dimension-only data set with start and end time columns representing validitiy windows for the dimension values, and MetricFlow will automatically join measures to the valid row entry. For details on limitations and future steps please refer to the [initial PR](https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/276). Note we no longer use the `primary` key type, as support for a `natural` key type was added in a [follow-up PR](https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/358). (@tlento)
- Support for percentile measure definitions (@kyleli626)
- Support for querying metrics without grouping by dimensions (@WilliamDee)
- Support for generating a MetricFlow model from a dbt cloud metric model (@QMalcolm)

- Support for passing in query tags for Snowflake queries (@plypaul)
- DataFlowPlan optimization to reduce source table scans (@plypaul)
- Internal API to enable developers to fetch joinable data source targets from an input data source (@courtneyholcomb)

- Added CI coverage for Databricks SQL Warehouse execution environments (@tlento)

### Fixed

- Resolved error encountered in Databricks whenever table rename methods were invoked (@courtneyholcomb)

- Issue with parsing `explain` output for Databricks SQL warehouse configurations (@courtneyholcomb)
- Floating point comparison errors in CI tests (@tlento)
- Issue with incomplete time range constraint validation that could result in invalid queries(@plypaul)
- Resolved GitHub upgrade warnings on use of deprecated APIs and node.js build versions (@tlento)
- Resolved python-levenshtein optimization warning on CLI startup (@jzhu13)

- Eliminate SQL rendering error in BigQuery which would intermittently produce invalid GROUP BY specifications (@tlento)

## MetricFlow [0.130.1] - 2022-10-19

### Added

- Support for overriding dbt `profile` and `targets` attributes when querying dbt models (@QMalcolm)
- Validation to block use of `DISTINCT` keyword in `COUNT` aggregation expressions, as this can lead to incorrect results if optimized queries relying on partial aggregation attempt to do something like `SUM(counts)` to retrieve a less granular total value. (@tlento)

### Updated

- Made minor improvements to safeguards for internal development (@tlento)

## MetricFlow [0.130.0] - 2022-10-18

### Added

- [#292](https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/292) This is the initial implementation of the MetricFlow dbt metrics integration. Allows MetricFlow to bootstrap itself natively from a dbt project that has metrics ðŸŽ‰

### Updated

- Refactored the semantic layer to use the MetricReference object as opposed to MetricSpec (@WilliamDee)

## [0.120.0] - 2022-10-13

### Breaking Changes

- Minor API change on SqlClient protocol could break existing API users writing custom SqlClient classes. MyPy should detect this issue. See [the relevant PR](https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/282) for details.

### Added

- Support for Databricks! Now you can use Metricflow with your Databricks-backed warehouse! (@courtneyholcomb)
- The ability to define constraints on input measures for ratio and expr metric types. This is a temporary quality of life improvement until full-featured derived metrics (i.e., metrics based on other metrics) are available. (@tlento)
- Support for different time granularities, improved group by expression handling, and corrected constraint handling on semi-additive measures (@WilliamDee)
- Support for `count` as a measure aggregation type. Note this is implemented as an alias around `sum`, so use of the `DISTINCT` keyword in expressions is not supported, and will be blocked via validation in a separate update. Users wishing for a `COUNT(DISTINCT thing)` equivalent should continue to use the `count_distinct` aggregation type. (@WilliamDee)

### Fixed

- Resolved incorrect constraint handling with semi-additive measures (@WilliamDee)
- Eliminated Dataclass deserialization errors on default parameters (@tlento)

### Updated

- Optimized multi-hop join candidate selection (@plypaul)
- Improved error handling and error messages on config validation (@QMalcolm, @tlento)
- Streamlined our project README (@nhandel)
- CLI now accepts metric-only queries in limited circumstances. See the assertion checks [in the PR](https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/256) for details. We will announce this as a new feature when it is complete, but for the time being users may try it out to see if it meets their needs in its current form. (@WilliamDee)

## MetricFlow [0.111.1] - 2022-08-30

### Added

- A lightweight Visual Studio Code [extension for authoring configs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Transform.metricflow) with simple support for inline schema validation and auto-completion! Local repo changes limited to JSON schema generation. (@jack-transform)
- Metric model template for Shopify metrics - if you use Shopify, this template can get you up and running for tracking your Shopify metrics! (@hesham-nawaz)

### Fixed

- Fixed warehouse validation failures caused by interaction with measure-specific aggregation times (@QMalcolm)
- Resolved intermittent semantic validation failures due to unpicklable pydantic objects (@tlento)
- Fixed edge case with semi-additive measures failing on certain join dimension connections (@WilliamDee)
- Restructured semantic container depedencies to eliminate certain classes of circular import errors (@tlento)

### Updated

- Replaced Pydantic objects with serializable Dataclasses to improve plan building speed. This can reduce time to generate dataflow plans by 10-20x for complex queries. (@plypaul)
- Refactored validation logic to make it easier to reason about (@QMalcolm)
- Modified inference detection rules to make it more likely to classify low cardinality string columns as categorical dimensions (@tlento)

## MetricFlow [0.111.0] - 2022-08-10

### Added

- Early beta for data source inference - Snowflake users can now run a command to bootstrap data source definitions based on warehouse metadata for tables in a given schema. Check out `mf infer --help` for more details. Feedback welcome! (@serramatutu)
- Support for semi-additive measures - semi-additive measures are measures which can be aggregated across some dimensions, but not others. The most common use case for this is an end-of-period measure, such as a statement balance or end of day inventory hold. As of this release we support semi-additive restrictions bound by any time dimension. See the description on [PR #183](https://github.com/transform-data/metricflow/pull/183) for more details on usage. (@WilliamDee)
- Expanded data warehouse validations - data warehoue validation runs will now check to ensure all measures, identifiers, and dimensions defined in data sources are queryable. (@QMalcolm)

### Fixed

- Resolved serialization error on custom Pydantic objects in the model parser (@tlento)
- Cleaned up error message handling and missing test depencies on model validation (@tlento)
- Eliminated a class of circular import errors by forking reference classes from the specs module (@WilliamDee)
- Fixed error state when specifying a where constraint with metric_time (@plypaul)
- Removed unused jsonschema element (@QMalcolm)

### Updated

- Updated the tutorial to use metric_time instead of arbitrary time dimensions (@plypaul)
- Increased strictness of typechecking enforcement (@tlento)
- Removed unnecessary "all time" WHERE clause rendering for cases where time constraints were not provided (@WilliamDee)
- Updated Click version from `^8.1.3` to `>=7.1.2` to temporarily resolve dependency issue for downstream Flask `1.1.4` usage (@jack-transform)
- Updated Jinja2 version from `2.11.0` to `>=2.11.0` to allow downstream Flask `1.1.4` users to update to `2.x.x` (@jpreillymb, @tlento)

## MetricFlow [0.110.1] - 2022-07-25

### Fixed

- Cleaned up package metadata and broken links in external README viewers (@tlento)
- Fixed cases where output columns were rendering in the wrong order (@WilliamDee)

### Updated

- Improved model config schema validation to return all jsonschema errors instead of one at a time (@QMalcolm)
- Streamlined rendered SQL to use BETWEEN expressions for date range checks (@WilliamDee)

## MetricFlow [0.110.0] - 2022-07-21

### Breaking Changes

- Updated query inputs for time series dimensions to use `metric_time` instead of dimension names, since it is now possible for measures to have different time dimensions for time series aggregation. This also removes the restriction that all data sources have the same primary time dimension name. However, users issuing queries might experience exceptions if they are not using `metric_time` as their requested primary time dimension. (@plypaul)
- Added enforcement for new reserved keyword `metric_time` (@tlento)
- Reordered column output to `time dimension, identifiers, dimensions, metrics`, which could break automation relying on order-dependent parsing of CLI output. We encourage affected users to switch to using the API, and to access the resulting data frame with order-independent (i.e., by name) access to column values. (@WilliamDee)
- Removed support for SQLite - expected impact is minimal as the repo has been cut to DuckDB for in memory testing (@plypaul)

### Added

- Support for specifying measure-specific time dimensions for time series aggregations (@plypaul)
- Validation against use of SQL reserved keywords as element names, which previously would have resulted in SQL errors at query time (@QMalcolm)

### Updated

- Improved code structure around the model validation process (@QMalcolm)
- Improved readability of model validation errors in CLI output (@QMalcolm)
- Cleaned up DuckDB documentation (@yanghua)
- Fixed edge case with model parsing where a constraint like `ds = CURRENT_DATE()` would throw an error (@tlento)
- Restructured config parser to rely more on Pydantic's built in object parsing, allowing for more - and more standardized - customization on input types and parsing mechanics (@tlento)
- Removed framework operation comments from SQL explain plans by default, added a flag to override (@WilliamDee, @nhandel)
- Updated Click to 8.1.3 to resolve dependency conflicts and facilitate later addition of command completion (@jack-transform)
- Improved developer documentation and workflows for PostgreSQL

## MetricFlow [0.100.2] 2022-06-24
