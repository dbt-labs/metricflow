### Features

- Add Trino support to the MetricFlow. ([#207](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/207))
- Implemented date_part in where filter. ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- Resolve Ambiguous Group-By-Items ([#887](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/887))
- Support for Conversion Metrics ([#252](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/252))
- Add a Query Validation Rule for Repeated Metrics in a Query ([#943](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/943))
- Expose label on Metric & Dimension for use in APIs. ([#956](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/956))

### Fixes

- Apply time offset for nested dervied & ratio metrics ([#882](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/882))
- Fix Incorrect SQL Column Name Rendering for WhereConstraintNode ([#908](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/908))
- `Unable To Satisfy Query Error` with Cumulative Metrics in Saved Queries ([#917](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/917))
- Fixes a bug in dimension-only queries where the filter column is removed before the filter has been applied. ([#923](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/923))
- Bug fix: Keep where constraint column until used for nested derived offset metric queries. ([#930](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/930))
- Fixes incorrect time constraint applied to derived offset metrics. ([#925](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/925))
- Remove default time constraint for queries with cumulative metrics. ([#917](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/917))
- Return exit code 1 for failed validations ([#867](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/867))

### Under the Hood

- Test to ensure Dimension and TimeDimension syntax are identical in the case of time dimensions
- Fixed typo in error message

### Dependencies
