## MetricFlow 0.207.1 - January 24, 2025

### Breaking Changes

- Changes MetricFlowQueryRequest.where_constraint to where_constraints and now accepts a list ([#1431](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1431))
- Require Python `>=3.9` ([#1470](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1470))

### Features

- Enable predicate pushdown for categorical dimensions ([#1011](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1011))
- Support sub-daily granularity options in SQL rendering for all supported SQL engines. ([#1258](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1258))
- Adds a new dataflow plan node to re-aggregate metrics using window functions. Needed to calculate cumulative metrics at non-default granularities. ([#1274](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1274))
- Build dataflow plan for cumulative metrics queried with non-default granularity. ([#1281](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1281))
- Remove restriction on querying non-default granularities with cumulative metrics. ([#1282](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1282))
- Enable predicate pushdown optimization by default for all callers ([#1011](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1011))
- Use Metric.time_granularity to resolve metric_time. ([#1310](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1310))
- Support multiple time spines with different granularities. ([#1348](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1348))
- Enable sub-daily queries without metrics. ([#1359](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1359))
- Enable sub-daily time constraints. ([#1367](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1367))
- Support combining AggregateMeasuresNodes where metric input measures have aliases, so long as there are no duplicates. ([#1375](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1375))
- Handle custom granularities in DataflowPlan. ([#1382](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1382))
- Support custom granularities in query parsing. ([#1413](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1413))
- Support conversion metrics queried with custom granularities. ([#1475](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1475))
- Basic support for join_to_timespine metrics with custom grain in the group by. ([#1505](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1505))
- Use CTEs instead of sub-queries in generated SQL. ([#1040](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1040))

### Fixes

- When querying multiple agg time or metric time dimensions with a cumulative metric, select all of them from the time spine table. ([#1271](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1271))
- Remove extraneous where filter subqueries added by predicate pushdown ([#1011](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1011))
- Add Column header to the exported CSV from query command
- Allow metrics with matching input measures where one is cumulative and one is not. ([#1374](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1374))
- Fixes bug where conversion metric query fails when filter with base semantic model's dimension is provided ([#1210](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1210))
- Bug fix: ensure that granularity requested for non-additive dimension is respected. ([#1383](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1383))
- Bug fix: when querying a join_to_timespine metric with a metric_time filter that is not included in the group by, unexpected output rows were included. ([#1450](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1450))
- Remove unnecessary group bys that make queries less efficient. ([#1453](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1453))
- Add new validation that checks for SCDs in the join path to make grouping by `metric_time` required in this case. ([#1451](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1451))
- Make ID generation thread-safe ([#1473](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1473))
- Prevent SourceScanOptimizer from combining nodes that use the same input metric alias in different derived metrics ([#1494](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1494))
- Fix `mf tutorial` experience. ([#1631](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1631))
- Compatibility Issue with dbt-core 1.9.0 and dbt-metricflow 0.7.1. ([#1589](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1589))
- dbt-core dependency issue with metricflow==0.207.0. ([#1632](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1632))

### Under the Hood

- Add test coverage for more filter + join interactions ([#1240](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1240))
- Add dataflow plan optimizer to replace build-time predicate pushdown ([#1011](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1011))
- Added filtering for DWH validation tasks and saved query support ([#1271](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1271))
- Refine subquery ID generation. This may result in changing subquery ids for rendered SQL. ([#1280](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1280))
- Move categorical dimension predicate pushdown to DataflowPlanOptimizer ([#1011](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1011))
- Consume cumulative-specific metric type params from new cumulative_type_params field. ([#1293](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1293))

### Dependencies

- Allow pydantic 2.x installations ([#1299](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1299))
