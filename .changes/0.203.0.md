## MetricFlow 0.203.0 - November 13, 2023

### Breaking Changes

- Use FULL OUTER JOIN to combine input metrics for derived metrics. This is a change from using INNER JOIN and may result in changes in output. ([#842](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/842))
- Update Dependencies to Use `dbt-semantic-interfaces~=0.4.0` ([#846](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/846))

### Features

- Enable DATE PART aggregation for time dimensions ([#770](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/770))
- Support Saved Queries in MetricFlow ([#765](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/765))
- Support for sort order in query interface ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- Support for the Dimension(...).grain(...) syntax for the where parameter ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- Support querying dimensions without metrics. ([#804](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/804))
- Join to time spine and fill nulls when requested on metric input measures. ([#759](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/759))
- Fill nulls for multi-metric queries ([#850](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/850))

### Fixes

- Removing methods and reordering parameters for Query Interface. ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- Coerce time granularity to configured value to prevent finer-grained timestamps from causing unexpected query behavior ([#714](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/714))
- Prioritize source nodes based on correct cost ([#801](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/801))
- Enables case insensitivity for various query params. ([#802](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/802))
- Ensure extract calls return consistent results across engines ([#792](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/792))
- The --order param was being dropped from CLI saved queries. ([#835](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/835))
- Fix query validation for metric_time requirements ([#825](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/825))
- Use FULL OUTER JOIN for dimension-only queries. ([#863](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/863))

### Under the Hood

- A simple update to make the where filter query parameter objects more accurate ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- Expose underlying where clause error message ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- Remove query interface and depend on DSI protocol instead ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- re-categorize `TypeErrors` that arise from `create_from_where_filter` into `InvalidQueryException` ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- Add the ability to use distinct select in sql nodes ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))
- Removed DatePart Enum and change imports to depend on DSI version instead. ([#None](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/None))

### Dependencies

- Update to dbt-semantic-interfaces~=0.3.0. ([#809](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/pull/809))
- Update typing-extensions minimum version to 4.4 ([#823](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/pull/823))
- Update dbt dependencies to ~=1.7.0 ([#860](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/pull/860))
