## MetricFlow 0.207.2 - February 21, 2025

### Features

- Allow setting aliases for queried metrics ([#1573](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1573))

### Fixes

- Always treat metric_time and the agg_time_dimension the same in the JoinToTimeSpineNode. ([#1541](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1541))
- Apply time constraints after time offsets to avoid filtering out values that will change later in the query. ([#1544](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1544))
- Update mf tutorial flow to always create / use the sample dbt project. ([#1651](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1651))
