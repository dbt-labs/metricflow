# Always support a range of production DSI versions capped at the next breaking version in metricflow-semantics.
# This allows us to sync new, non-breaking changes to dbt-core without getting a version mismatch in dbt-mantle,
# which depends on a specific commit of DSI.
# bumping to 0.9.3 will cause test failures, so pinning to dev2 until fixed
