docstring:
  Tests an input with an ambiguous entity-path that can't be resolved due to a mismatch between metrics.

      'entity_0__country' matches ['entity_1__entity_0__country', 'entity_0__country']

Got error(s) during query resolution.

Error #1:
  Message:

    Query(['entity_0_metric', 'entity_1_metric']) is built from:

      SimpleMetric('entity_0_metric'), SimpleMetric('entity_1_metric').

    However, the given input does not match to a common item that is available to those parents:

      {
        "Matching items for: SimpleMetric('entity_0_metric')": ['entity_0__country'],
        "Matching items for: SimpleMetric('entity_1_metric')": [
          'entity_1__entity_0__country',
        ],
      }

    For time-dimension inputs, please specify a time grain as resolution of ambiguous grains
    is successful only when the parents have the same defined time grain.

  Query Input:

    entity_0__country
