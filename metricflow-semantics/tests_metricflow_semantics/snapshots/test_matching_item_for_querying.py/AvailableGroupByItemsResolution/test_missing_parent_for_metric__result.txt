test_name: test_missing_parent_for_metric
test_filename: test_matching_item_for_querying.py
docstring:
  Tests a search for a group by item with a metric stub with no parents.

      We operate under the logical assumption that metric and query items have parent nodes - for a query,
      these are the inputs (group by items, metrics, etc.). For metrics, these are the metric inputs (metrics
      or measures). However, in the event of a validation gap upstream, we sometimes encounter inscrutable errors
      caused by missing parent nodes for these input types, so we add a more informative error and test for it here.
