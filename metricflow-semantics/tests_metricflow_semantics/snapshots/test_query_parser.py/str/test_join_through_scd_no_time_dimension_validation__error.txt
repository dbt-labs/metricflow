Got errors while resolving the query.

Error #1:
  Message:

    Your query contains the following group bys, which are SCDs or contain SCDs in the join path: ['listing__user__home_state_latest'].

    A query containing SCDs must also contain the metric_time dimension in order to join the SCD table to the valid time range. Please add metric_time to the query and try again. If you're using agg_time_dimension, use metric_time instead.

  Query Input:

    Query(['bookings'], ['listing__user__home_state_latest']

  Issue Location:

    [Resolve Query(['bookings'])]
      -> [Resolve Metric('bookings')]
