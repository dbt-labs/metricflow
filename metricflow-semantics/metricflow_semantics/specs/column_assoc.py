    This is used for naming columns in an SQL query consistently. For example, dimensions with links are
    named like <entity link>__<dimension name> e.g. user_id__country, and time dimensions at a different time
    granularity are named <time dimension>__<time granularity> e.g. ds__month. Having a central place to name them will
    make it easier to change this later on. Names generated need to be unique within a query.

    It's also important to maintain this format because customers write constraints in SQL assuming this. This
    allows us to stick the constraint in as WHERE clauses without having to parse the constraint SQL.

    TODO: Updates are needed for time granularity in time dimensions, ToT for metrics.
