  description: |
    Saved query that includes a cumulative metric. Added as cumulative metrics have a branch in the CLI for
    adjusting the time constraint.

    group_by:
      - TimeDimension('metric_time', 'day')

saved_query:
  name: saved_query_with_metric_joins_and_filter
  description: |
    Saved query that includes multiple metrics from different input sources requiring a metric join and
    a query-level filter on a mix of categorical and time dimension filters.
    Note this will not run on Trino due to the invalid filter construction - Trino will not cast string literals
    to timestamp types the way other engines do.
  query_params:
    metrics:
      - bookings
      - views
      - bookings_per_view
    group_by:
      - Dimension('listing__capacity_latest')
    where:
      - "{{ Dimension('listing__is_lux_latest') }}"
      - "{{ TimeDimension('metric_time', 'day') }} >= '2020-01-02'"
